/**
 * Runs the committed bundle, as a process, against a fake GitHub over real

 * clients, the changelog preset's own file reads, and the bundling that turns
 * all of it into one artifact. Two bugs lived in exactly that span, and the
 * suite was green through both:
 *
 *   - the GraphQL endpoint was assembled as `.../graphql/graphql`, because a
 *     runner's GITHUB_GRAPHQL_URL is the endpoint and release-please wants the
 *     API root;
 *   - the changelog preset reads four Handlebars templates from
 *     `__dirname/templates/`, which an ESM bundle has neither of.
 *
 * Both were found by running the action on its own pull request. This is that
 * run, made cheap and offline enough to keep.
