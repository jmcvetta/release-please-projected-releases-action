A GitHub Action for repositories that squash-merge: it comments on a pull
request with the release-please tags merging it will cut — or says plainly
that nothing is released. The numbers come from a bundled release-please, not
a reimplementation of its rules.

One sticky comment, re-rendered as the title or the branch changes. When
nothing releases there is no table, just ``None — `docs:` produces no
release.``

It also says when the numbers cannot be trusted. If a component's entry in
`.release-please-manifest.json` names a version that no release or tag
matches, release-please has no boundary to compute from: it replays the
component's whole history into one changelog and reaches a version by
arithmetic over all of it. That is what a lost tag looks like — and what a
first release looks like — so the comment reports the disagreement and marks
the affected version as unreliable rather than presenting it as the answer.

## Does it fit your repository?

- **release-please**, manifest mode or plain mode (`release-type:`).
- **Squash-merge**, which is what makes the title the commit. Merge commits
  and rebase are planned —
  [#50](https://github.com/jmcvetta/release-please-projected-releases-action/issues/50).

## Quick start

Copy to `.github/workflows/projected-releases.yml`:

```yaml
name: Projected releases
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, edited]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: jmcvetta/release-please-projected-releases-action@v0
```

Keep `edited` in the trigger list: the projection comes from the title, so a
title fixed after review has to re-render. Keep `fetch-depth: 0` too: the
checkout answers what each commit changed, which the API otherwise answers one
request per commit. `@v0` tracks the latest `0.x`, and
[`examples/projected-releases.yml`](examples/projected-releases.yml) adds a
`concurrency` group and skips release-please's own release pull requests.

## Configuration

None, where release-please reads `release-please-config.json` and
`.release-please-manifest.json` from the repository.

Without those files, release-please is configured by the `release-type:` your
release workflow passes it. Pass this action the same value:

```yaml
      - uses: jmcvetta/release-please-projected-releases-action@v0
        with:
          release-type: node
```

Setting it is what selects that mode — here as on `release-please-action`,
where its presence is likewise the switch — so the two have to agree. Set it
where your release workflow does not and the projection describes a
configuration that will never run; the comment says so when it can tell, which
is when the config files are in the checkout, or when a `config-file` or
`manifest-file` path was given for a file this mode never opens.

`versioning-strategy` and `release-as` are passed the same way, and matter for
the same reason: a workflow bumping with `always-bump-patch` releases a feature
as a patch, and `release-as` is sticky — it holds until the line is removed. A
projection that has not been told about either reports the version a default
repository would get.

`component` and `tag-separator` go the other way: `release-please-action` has
no input for them at all, so leave them alone unless something other than it
cuts your releases.
