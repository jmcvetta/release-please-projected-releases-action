# Squash-only merging with a PR_TITLE subject and a PR_BODY body is
# load-bearing rather than taste. release-please parses commit subjects on
# master, so the pull request title has to become the master commit subject,
# and a `Release-As:` trailer reaches release-please only through the pull
# request body. Re-enabling merge or rebase commits would put unparseable
# subjects on master and break version selection silently -- silently, because
# a release pull request would still open, just with the wrong number on it.

    # decides whether a merge cuts a tag and how far the version moves. A
    # miscased type is the case worth requiring a check over: `Feat:` renders
    # a correct-looking Features entry and bumps a patch, with no error
    # anywhere. Advisory was not enough, because the only place that failure
    # shows up is a red check nobody is obliged to read.
    #
    # `validate-title` is a check-run name, not a workflow name: for an
    # Actions job it is the job's `name:` when it has one and its job id

    # string and that job id are one pair spanning two files in two
    # languages, and renaming either alone leaves a required check nothing
    # ever reports -- pending forever, blocking every pull request, fixable
    # only by someone applying this stack by hand. src/pr-title-check.test.ts
    # pins the two together.
    #
    # KNOWN COST, until the release job authenticates as a GitHub App: the
    # release pull request receives no checks at all. GitHub suppresses
    # workflow events for everything the default token pushes, and
    # release-please.yml falls back to that token while RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID
    # and RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY are unset -- measured on #42, which has
    # zero check runs. So this check sits "expected" on the one pull request
    # whose merge cuts a tag, and merging it takes the admin bypass declared
    # above. Setting up the App removes the bypass step and is the real fix;
    # `test` stays unrequired for the same reason until then.
