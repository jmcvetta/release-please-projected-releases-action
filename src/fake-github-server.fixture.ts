/**
 * fake-github-server serves just enough of the GitHub API, over real HTTP, to
 * drive one projection end to end.
 *
 * The other fixture, fake-scm, substitutes a `GitHub` object and so skips
 * everything between this action's options and release-please's HTTP calls:
 * URL assembly, the Octokit clients, and the whole bundled artifact. Two bugs
 * lived in exactly that gap and neither was reachable from a unit test -- a
 * GraphQL URL built as `.../graphql/graphql`, and a changelog preset reading
 * template files that the bundle did not ship.
 *
 * So this fake is deliberately literal about URLs. It serves GraphQL at
 * `/graphql` and nothing else, which is what makes a wrongly-assembled
 * endpoint a 404 here exactly as it is against github.com.
 *
 * It serves two families of endpoint, and the distinction is worth keeping in
 * mind when adding to it. release-please reads the git trees, blobs, tags and
 * GraphQL history; the action reads the repository's merge settings and its
 * open pull requests, lists a pull request's files, and posts its own comment.
 * Only the first family is needed to render a projection -- but an entry point
 * makes both, and the decisions worth testing in src/action.ts are about what
 * it does when one of the second family fails.
