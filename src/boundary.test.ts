/**
 * These tests drive real release-please against a repository whose manifest
 * and tags disagree.
 *
 * The end-to-end cases are the point of the file. `boundary.ts` reads a line
 * release-please logs, which is a seam: the wording is not part of any public
 * contract and an upgrade could move it, at which point the warning would
 * simply stop appearing — a check that quietly stops checking, which is the
 * failure this warning exists to prevent, arriving by the back door. Nothing
 * short of running release-please detects that, so these tests run it.
