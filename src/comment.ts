/**
 * comment keeps one sticky comment on a pull request.
 *
 * Sticky because the projection is a statement about the current head, not a
 * log: a push, a title edit or a body edit each produce a new answer, and a
 * new comment per event would bury the pull request in stale ones. Editing in
 * place also means no notification for a re-render that says the same thing.
 *
 * The comment is found by a hidden HTML marker it writes into its own body,
 * never by "the newest comment from this identity" — a repository whose CI
 * leaves its own comments under the same bot would collide with that.
